I have worked as a Web Developer Intern at Wheelbox Automotive Pvt. Ltd., an early stage startup, from June 2020 to July 2020.
During the course of my internship, I developed the frontend of a home decor e-commerce website in JavaScript and integrated the backend with the frontend.
I also created various REST APIs in nodejs and maintained a detailed documentation of all API endpoints.
