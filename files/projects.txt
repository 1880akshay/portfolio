- Web Porfolio Terminal:
    I made this Ubuntu terminal based portfolio website written in JavaScript. I am not very good at designing, so gave the website a terminal look.
    The website is hosted here: <a href="https://1880akshay.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">https://1880akshay.github.io/portfolio/</a>
    The complete code for this website can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/1880akshay/portfolio" target="_blank">https://github.com/1880akshay/portfolio</a>

- CoviSahayata Mobile App:
    I made a native mobile app using Flutter and Firebase named CoviSahayata.
    The motivation behind this app was the lack of information regarding covid related resources among the people.
    This app provides a platform where people can submit their queries asking for leads of resources, and other people can message (in application chat) or call the person to provide the information.
    The complete code for this app can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/1880akshay/Covid-App" target="_blank">https://github.com/1880akshay/Covid-App</a>
