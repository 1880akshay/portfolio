- Web Porfolio Terminal:
    I made this Ubuntu terminal based portfolio website written in JavaScript. I am not very good at designing, so gave the website a terminal look.

- CoviSahayata Mobile App:
    I made a native mobile app using Flutter and Firebase named CoviSahayata.
    The motivation behind this app was the lack of information regarding covid related resources among the people.
    This app provides a platform where people can submit their queries asking for leads of resources, and other people can message (in application chat) or call the person to provide the information.
