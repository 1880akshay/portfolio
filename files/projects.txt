- CoviSahayata Mobile App:
    I made a native mobile app using Flutter and Firebase named CoviSahayata.
    The motivation behind this app was the lack of information regarding covid related resources among the people.
    This app provides a platform where users can submit their queries asking for leads of resources, and other users can provide the information via in-application chat or a phone call.
    The apk can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://github.com/1880akshay/Covid-App/blob/main/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk" target="_blank">CoviSahayata.apk</a>
